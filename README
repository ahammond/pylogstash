This is a simple log handler which ships logs to a logstash node 
via zeromq.  In order fo this to work, you must have a logstash node 
for zeromq messages.

This sends parsed messages in json form.  To specify fields to be added to the 
event, set the field list in the handler initializer.  Each of these fields 
from the LogRecord will be included in the @fields section of the event.

The timestamp field is set via datetime.datetime.isoformat().
